# _reveal-common - A shared repository for a consistent reveal.js teaching setup üè´
## Getting Started
To use this trainer configuations for your slides, follow these steps:

**1. Step** Clone this project into the root directory of your own project where you want to use the slides

**2. Step** Add the `_reveal-common` folder to your project's `.gitignore` file to ensure it is not tracked in version control

**3. Step** Move the `reveal-md.json` file to your project's root directory so that the local slide server can later pick up the shared configurations. Make sure to exclude it from version control by adding it to your `.gitignore` file.
The `<your-root>/.gitignore` should look like this:
```.gitignore
_reveal-common
reveal-md.json
```

**4. Step** Create your own slides and save them in the `slides/` folder of your root project (this is just a convention)

**5. Step** Start the local reveal-md server by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
reveal-md . -w
```

This will start a server that displays your slides in your web browser. Any specific configurations for your slides will be automatically loaded from the `reveal-md.json` file that you moved to your project's root directory.

## Documentation
### We should follow certain conventions
- Put your slides always in a `slide` folder (for each submodule), there you should also keep `img` folder containing images only for that set of slides
- Each slide needs to have a `md` extension and must contain the words slide. Example `css-1-slides.md`. Otherwise the files won't be shown in the index view (enforced [here](templates/listing-template.html))

### Stylesheets explained
The general idea of `style/style.css` is to have a consistent style and visual language across all slide decks. Some of the classes and ideas are explained here:
- TODO: flex and columns
- TODO: Annotate slide with exercise background

### Available Plugins explained
- **Chalkboard Plugin**
    - Press `b` to toggle between chalkboard and normal view
    - Press `c` to annotate current slides
    - Press `<del>` to delete chalkboard and annotation for current slide
    - Notes
      - Each annotation and chalkboard will be persisted per slide
      - You can also download all drawings with `<?>` (TODO), output is a JSON with some paths). Used for replaying.

## How to refresh the contents and use it?
1. git pull -r
2. Overwrite reveal-md.json in root folder (if original file changed)

On a unix file system you can also do a symbolic links so you do not need to do step 2 manually
```bash
ln -s $(realpath _reveal-common/reveal-md.json) .
```

## Why is the repo prepended with a `_`?
- Up to know reveal-md lists all files in a subdirectory. The underscore in the directory listing will keep all markdown files from the repository contained at the very beginning ;-)

## Development - Getting started
1. The paths in `reveal-md.json` are configured for executing it from the parent folder of root. In order to keep working with the file in root, use the following toggle scripts. Be aware this changes the file in-place.

- *Convert to development version*
```bash
sed -i '' 's/_reveal-common\///' reveal-md.json
```
- *Convert back to prod version*
```bash
sed -i '' 's/"\.\//"\.\/_reveal-common\//' reveal-md.json
```
2. Start the local server in dev version only
```bash
reveal-md . -w
```
## Fixes
- Currently, a listing template does not work when provided via `reveal-md.json`. Workaround is to provide it manually via flag
```bash
reveal-md . -w --listing-template _reveal-common/templates/listing-template.html
```

## Ideas/Todos
- Think of a mechanism where you can exclude whole markdown pages (e.g. pre-processing script on print)
- Think of a way to exclude markdown files from the initial listing when executing `reveal-md .`
